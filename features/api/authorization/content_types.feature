Feature: Content Types
  In order to ensure content types are not tampered with
  As an admin, designer or author
  I will be restricted based on my role

  Background:
    Given I have the site: "test site" set up
    And I have a custom model named "Projects" with id "4f832c2cb0d86d3f42fffffe" and
      | label       | type      | required        |
      | Name        | string    | true            |
      | Description | text      | false           |
    And I have a designer and an author

  Scenario: As an unauthenticated user
    Given I am not authenticated

    Then the JSON response at "error" should be "You need to sign in or sign up before continuing."
