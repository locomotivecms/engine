BOARD:

- duostack version
- bugs
  - editable_elements slug becomes nil
- pull requests #31 et #32
- editable_elements: inheritable: false (Mattias)
- 2 different sites on the same main domain (one in www, the other one in something else) (Raphael Costa)

BACKLOG:


- validation for custom fields
- new custom field types:
  - belongs_to => association

- inline editing (http://www.aloha-editor.com/wiki/index.php/Aloha_PHP_Example)
  - html view in the aloha popup
  - editable elements should wrap a tag: div, h1, ...etc (default span)
  - edit images (upload new ones, ...etc) => wait for aloha or send them an email ?

- global regions: keyword in editable element (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Updating)
- write my first tutorial about locomotive
- cucumber features for admin pages (in progress)

REFACTORING:

  - refactor slugify method (use parameterize + create a module)
  - move content_type and content_instances in the CustomFields plugin (much more appropriate)

BUGS:

- custom fields: accepts_nested_attributes weird behaviour when creating new content type + adding random fields

NICE TO HAVE:
- export site
- asset collections: custom resizing if image
- super_finder
- better icons for mime type
- traffic statistics
- asset picker (content instance)
- page with regexp url ?
- automatic update !
- page not found (front) => if logged in, link to create the page
- switch to list (theme assets / assets ?). delete all in once (with checkbox) or see details (updated_at, size, ...etc)
