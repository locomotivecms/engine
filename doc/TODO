BOARD:

x tinyMCE langs
x bug: fixed editable elements
x default editable content

- bugs / ui tweaks
  x unable to toggle the "required" check_boxes for content types
  x unable to sign out
  x unable to remove a field
  x "back to admin" link does not work if inline editor disabled
  x unable to delete memberships
  x disallow to click twice on the submit form button (spinner ?)
  x weird behaviour when changing the default locale of a site
  - editable_elements does not display the first time they get created (and if there are no existing ones)
  - display by categories does not work when localized
  - message to notify people if their browser is too old

? install a site by default at the first installation (without asking)

BACKLOG:

- custom_fields:
  - validation: regexp (pre-defined regexps ?)
  x new type: belongs_to => association
- inline editing (http://www.aloha-editor.com/wiki/index.php/Aloha_PHP_Example)
  - html view in the aloha popup
  - editable elements should wrap a tag: div, h1, ...etc (default span)
  - edit images (upload new ones, ...etc) => wait for aloha or send them an email ?
- cucumber features for admin pages (in progress)
(- duostack/doutcloud version)
- write my first tutorial about locomotive
- upgrade warning if new version of locomotive (maybe based on the commit id)
- deploying workflow:
  - roll back a bad update
  - conflicts with content types
  - dev -> staging -> production
  - sync data
  - import only theme assets
- endless pagination

- tooltip to explain the difference between 1.) Admin 2.) Author 3.) Designer?
- [bushido] guiders / welcome page / devise cas authentication (SSO)

REFACTORING:

  - move content_type and content_instances in the CustomFields plugin (much more appropriate)

BUGS:
  x mode author: settings KO + editable elements non visibles
  x locales pour le locomotive editor => KO
  ! impossible de sauvegarder une page


NICE TO HAVE:
- export site
- super_finder
- traffic statistics
- asset picker (content instance)
- page with regexp url ?
- automatic update !
- page not found (front) => if logged in, link to create the page
- switch to list (theme assets / assets ?). delete all in once (with checkbox) or see details (updated_at, size, ...etc)
- code completion ? http://blog.quplo.com/2010/06/common-sense-code-completion/
