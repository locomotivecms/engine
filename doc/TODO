BOARD:

x bugs:
  x #50
  x #51
~ editable_elements: inheritable: false (Mattias) => seems to be fixed by Dirk's last pull request (#44) => content tag
- upgrade warning if new version of locomotive (maybe based on the commit id)
- duostack version
- 2 different sites on the same main domain (one in www, the other one in something else) (Raphael Costa)
- seo section for the page form: seo title, seo keywords, seo description
- icon for redirection page in the pages section (back-office)

BACKLOG:

- custom_fields:
  - validation: regexp (pre-defined regexps ?)
  - new type: belongs_to => association
- inline editing (http://www.aloha-editor.com/wiki/index.php/Aloha_PHP_Example)
  - html view in the aloha popup
  - editable elements should wrap a tag: div, h1, ...etc (default span)
  - edit images (upload new ones, ...etc) => wait for aloha or send them an email ?
- global regions: keyword in editable element (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Updating)
- write my first tutorial about locomotive
- cucumber features for admin pages (in progress)

REFACTORING:

  - refactor slugify method (use parameterize + create a module)
  - move content_type and content_instances in the CustomFields plugin (much more appropriate)

BUGS:

NICE TO HAVE:
- export site
- asset collections: custom resizing if image
- super_finder
- traffic statistics
- asset picker (content instance)
- page with regexp url ?
- automatic update !
- page not found (front) => if logged in, link to create the page
- switch to list (theme assets / assets ?). delete all in once (with checkbox) or see details (updated_at, size, ...etc)
- resizing images on the fly
- code completion ? http://blog.quplo.com/2010/06/common-sense-code-completion/
