- global regions: keyword in editable element (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Updating)
- cucumber features for admin pages (in progress)
(- duostack/doutcloud version)
- write my first tutorial about locomotive

- deploying workflow:
  - roll back a bad update
  - conflicts with content types
  - dev -> staging -> production
  - sync data
  - import only theme assets
- endless pagination
- override sort for contents
- tooltip to explain the difference between 1.) Admin 2.) Author 3.) Designer?
- [bushido] guiders / welcome page / devise cas authentication (SSO)

REFACTORING:

BUGS:

NICE TO HAVE:
- export site
- super_finder
- traffic statistics
- asset picker (content instance)
- page with regexp url ?
- automatic update !
- page not found (front) => if logged in, link to create the page
- switch to list (theme assets / assets ?). delete all in once (with checkbox) or see details (updated_at, size, ...etc)
- code completion ? http://blog.quplo.com/2010/06/common-sense-code-completion/
