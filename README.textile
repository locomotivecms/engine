h1. Locomotive CMS

"!https://secure.travis-ci.org/locomotivecms/engine.png!":http://travis-ci.org/locomotivecms/engine


Locomotive is a simple but powerful CMS based on liquid templates and mongodb database. At my company ("NoCoffee":http://www.nocoffee.fr), we use it for our clients when they request a simple website.

If we have to give only 5 main features to describe our application, there will be:

* managing as many websites as you want with one application instance
* nice looking UI (see http://www.locomotivecms.com for some screenshots)
* flexible content types
* playing smoothly with Heroku and MongoHQ
* inline editing (beta)

h2. Strategy / Development status

We already developed a fully functional prototype in Rails 2.3.2 with both active record / mongomapper and it worked quite well. We are even using it for some client websites.
Now, our goal is to port our prototype to Rails 3 and migrate from mongomapper to mongoid. Besides, we put a lot of efforts to make it as robust as we can by writing better specs than we wrote for the prototype at first.

h2. Gems

Here is a short list of main gems used in the application.

* Rails 3.0.10
* Mongoid 2.0.2 (with MongoDB 1.8)
* Liquid
* Devise
* Carrierwave
* Haml
* Delayed job
* Jammit-s3
