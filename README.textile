LocomotiveCMS is a simple but powerful CMS based on liquid templates and mongodb database. At my company ("NoCoffee":http://www.nocoffee.fr), we use it for our clients when they request a simple website.

If we have to give a couple of features to describe our application, there will be:

* managing as many websites as you want with one application instance
* nice looking UI (see http://www.locomotivecms.com for some screenshots)
* flexible content types
* content localization out of the box
* playing smoothly with Heroku, Bushido and MongoHQ
* inline editing (wip)
* API

h2. Strategy / Development status

We already developed a fully functional prototype in Rails 2.3.2 with both active record / mongomapper and it worked quite well. We are even using it for some client websites.
Now, our goal is to port our prototype to Rails 3 and migrate from mongomapper to mongoid. Besides, we put a lot of efforts to make it as robust as we can by writing better specs than we wrote for the prototype at first.

h2. Gems

Here is a short list of main gems / technologies used in the application.

* Rails 3.2.13
* Mongoid 3.1.3 (with MongoDB 2.x)
* Liquid
* Devise
* Carrierwave
* Haml
* Formtastic
* Cells
* Coffeescript / Backbone / SASS

h2. Installation

See the "installation documentation on the official website":http://doc.locomotivecms.com

h2. Upgrading

We work on the procedure to upgrade from a previous version of the engine (below the 2.0.0)
