Locomotive is an open source platform to create, publish and edit sites. It is designed to save your time and help you focus on what matters: front-end technology, standard development process and no learning time for your client.

Locomotive relies on a **very original workflow**.

- Sites are coded locally using our open source tool: [Wagon](https://github.com/locomotivecms/wagon). A desktop version (not open source) is also available [here](http://www.wagonapp.com).
- Sites are deployed to the platform (engine) thanks to our internal API.
- A back-office for the end-users is automatically generated based on the custom models and editable regions described by the developers.

Visit the Locomotive official website [here](http://www.locomotivecms.com) for more information.

## Development Status ##

As you can see from the commit logs, we are intensively working on the new V3 version. We kept all the features from our stable [v2 version](https://github.com/locomotivecms/engine/tree/v2.5.x), we just replace the UI, upgrade the gems and refactor our code.

## Getting Started ##

If you can not wait for playing with our new version, you still can use the current one (v2.5.x). Check out our [installation guide](http://doc.locomotivecms.com/get-started).

## Features ##
