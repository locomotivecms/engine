Locomotive is an open source platform to create, publish and edit sites (CMS). It is designed to save time and help you focus on what matters: front-end technology, standard development process and a very low learning curve for your clients.

Locomotive relies on a **very original workflow**:

- Sites are coded locally using our open source tool: [Wagon](https://github.com/locomotivecms/wagon).
- Sites are deployed to the platform (engine) thanks to our internal API.
- A back-office for the end-users is automatically generated based on the custom models and editable regions described by the developers.

### Technologies

Here is a list of the main gems used to power the Locomotive platform:

- Rails 5     - *web framework*
- Bootstrap   - *UI framework*
- Mongoid 6   - *Object-Document-Mapper for MongoDB 3*

### Translating the back-office

By default, the Locomotive back-office is fully translated in English, Dutch and Greek.

Adding a new language is pretty straightforward since we now manage all our I18n translation keys in [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com), a platform dedicated to this kind of task.

Here is our Transifex portal page: [https://www.transifex.com/locomotive/locomotive-engine](https://www.transifex.com/locomotive/locomotive-engine). Feel free to sign up and translate!
