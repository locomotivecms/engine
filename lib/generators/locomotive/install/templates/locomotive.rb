  # config.multi_sites do |multi_sites|
  #   # each new website you add will have a default entry based on a subdomain
  #   # and the multi_site_domain value (ex: website_1.locomotivehosting.com).
  #   multi_sites.domain = 'example.com' #'myhostingplatform.com'

  # configure the hosting target for the production environment. Locomotive can be installed in:
  # - your own server
  # - Heroku (you need to create an account in this case)
  # - Bushi.do (see the bushi.do website for more explanations)
  #
  # the possible options are: server, heroku, bushido or auto (default)
  # if you select 'auto', Locomotive will look after specific ENV variables to check
  # the matching platform (Heroku and Bushido set their own ENV variables).
  #
  config.hosting = :auto

  # In case you host Locomotive in Heroku, the engine uses the heroku api to add / remove domains.

  #   - from ENV variables: HEROKU_LOGIN & HEROKU_PASSWORD
  #   - from this file, see the example below and uncomment it if needed

  #   :login      => '<your_heroku_login>',
  #   :password   => '<your_heroku_password>'

  # Locomotive uses the DelayedJob gem for the site import module.
  # In case you want to deploy to Heroku, you will have to pay for an extra dyno.
  # If you do not mind about importing theme without DelayedJob, disable it.

  # Warning: this option is not used if you deploy on bushi.do and we set automatically the value to true.

  # Configure the e-mail address which will be shown in the DeviseMailer, NotificationMailer, ...etc
  # if you do not put the domain name in the email, Locomotive will take the default domain name depending
  # on your deployment target (server, Heroku, Bushido, ...etc)
  #
  # Ex:
  # config.mailer_sender = 'support'
  # # => 'support@heroku.com' (Heroku), 'support@bushi.do' (Bushido), 'support@example.com' (Dev) or 'support@<your_hosting_platform>' (Multi-sites)

  #   :entitystore => URI.encode("file:#{Rails.root}/tmp/dragonfly/cache/body")
  # }
  # If you do want to disable it for good, just use the following syntax
  # config.rack_cache = false
  #
  # Note: by default, rack/cache is disabled in the Heroku platform
